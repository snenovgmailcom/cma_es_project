    This multiobjective optimization algorithm uses a solution's exclusive
    contribution to the hypervolume of the worst non-dominated front of a
    population as a selection criterion. (Hypervolume was formerly known as
    S-metric.) The algorithm was proposed in [Emmerich2005]_ and
    [Naujoks2005]_. This class inherits from :class:`EvolutionaryAlgorithm`.

    .. warning:: The time for calculating the hypervolume is exponential in
        the number of objectives.

        Parameters
        ----------
        problem : optproblems.Problem
            A multiobjective optimization problem.
        start_population : list of Individual
            The initial population of individuals. The size of this list
            does not have to be the same as `population_size`, but will be
            adjusted subsequently.
        population_size : int
            The number of individuals that will survive the selection step
            in each generation.
        num_offspring : int, optional
            The number of individuals born in every generation. This value
            is typically 1, but the implementation also admits larger
            values.
        reproduction : Reproduction, optional
            A :class:`Reproduction<evoalgos.reproduction.Reproduction>`
            object selecting the parents for mating and creating the
            offspring. If no object is provided, a default variant is
            generated, which selects parents uniformly random.
        prefer_boundary_points : bool, optional
            This flag only pertains to the two-objective case. If it is
            set to True, the two boundary points (but not their potentially
            existing duplicates) of a front are guaranteed to be retained.
        do_backward_elimination : bool, optional
            This argument only has influence if ``num_offspring > 1``.
            Backward elimination means that in a greedy fashion, the worst
            individuals are removed one by one. In this implementation,
            the alternative is a 'super-greedy' approach, which removes
            the necessary number of individuals without recalculating the
            fitness of the other ones in between. Default is True (the
            former approach), which is also recommended, because it is more
            accurate.
        offsets : list, optional
            For calculating the hypervolume, a reference point is required.
            The reference point is typically calculated as the worst
            objective values in the last front plus an offset vector, which
            can be specified here. Default offset is [1.0, ..., 1.0].
